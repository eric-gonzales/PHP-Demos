#Late Static Bindings

This is a test of the **PHP Late Static Bindings**. 

See: http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.late-static-bindings.php

##Examples
* 

##Notes
* The self keyword doesn't follow the rules of inheitance. Instead, self always resolves to the class in which it used. Self does not reference a method defined in the parent as one would expect. Late static binding allows the static keyword to represent the class in which it is first used.
