#Late Static Bindings

This is a test of the **PHP Generators**. 

See: http://php.net/manual/en/language.generators.overview.php

##Examples
* 

##Notes
* The `yield` keyword is the heart of a generator function. It looks like a return statement, but instead of stopping execution of the function, it provides a value to the code looping over the generator and pauses execution of the generator function.
* This is typically much easier and simpler than implementing an `Iterator` class.
